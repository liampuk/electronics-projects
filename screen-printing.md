# Screen Printing/PCB fabrication

## Vise design

This simple design for a vise functions as both a screen printing station, and a general vise (for drilling enclosures, etc.)

The basic design is to use 2 50x75mm timber blocks as each part of the vise, and lock them together using 2 threaded rods with wing nuts.

This can also be used for screen printing pedals:

or tshirts/other objects using a wooden block as a base:
